# Pascal Lexical Analyzer 

## Lexical Analysis
Lexical Analysis is the first phase of the compiler also known as a scanner. It converts the High level input program into a sequence of Tokens.

To Generate Tokens and symbol table from file in inputs folder:

    `python main.py ./inputs/source_code.pas`

Two Output files will be generated : 

    `outputs/pascal_tokens.csv`
    `outputs/symbol_table.csv`
